## Project Introduction

This project was developed to analyze and visualize digital campaign data. The project is based on the analysis of data pulled from AWS S3 into the Snowflake data warehouse, with the data being updated every 7 days through an automated process in Snowflake. An interactive dashboard was created using Streamlit to visualize the results. The main goal of this project is to provide a tool that allows for faster evaluation of campaign performance through the analysis and visualization of digital campaign data. By doing so, managers can accelerate their decision-making processes and quickly access cleaner, more organized, and easily accessible data.

**Data Collection:**
+ The necessary campaign data was pulled directly from AWS S3 into Snowflake using custom scripts and connectors.
+ Data was regularly updated every 7 days to ensure the most current campaign performance data was available for analysis.

**Data Cleaning and Processing:**
+ Raw campaign data was cleaned to remove any errors, null values, or inconsistencies.
+ Key metrics, such as Average Order Value (AOV), Click-Through Rate (CTR), Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), and Conversion Rates, were calculated to assess campaign effectiveness.


**Data Storage:**
+ After processing, the cleaned and aggregated data was stored in Snowflake, allowing for scalable, cloud-based storage and easy access for analysis.
+ Snowflake enabled efficient querying and aggregation of large datasets for in-depth analysis.

**Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:**
+ Relevant campaign metrics were analyzed, including monthly campaign counts, conversion rates, and revenue metrics.
+ Additional metrics such as "Scaled Average Order Value" were created by dividing AOV by a scaling factor (e.g., 1000) for easier visualization and comparison.

**Data Visualization:**
+ Streamlit was used to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key performance metrics, such as campaign count and average order value, in real-time.
+ The dashboard allows users to quickly compare campaign performance over time and explore detailed trends through visualizations.
+ Altair was used for creating dynamic, layered line charts with the ability to filter and zoom on specific data points.

**User Interaction and Decision Making:**
+ The dashboard empowers users to explore the data by month, campaign type, and performance metric.
+ By scaling the metrics appropriately, users can easily identify correlations between campaign frequency and key financial indicators like average order value.
